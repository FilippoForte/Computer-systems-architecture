# Computer-systems-architecture

This repository contains my solutions to laboratories and exams from the Computer systems architecture course at Politecnico di Torino. The purpose of the course is to provide knowledge on the elaboration system architecture, with a particular attention to microprocessor based sistems. The course analyzes the several components of an elaboration system: from the microprocessor internal architecture, up to system bus for peripheral devices management. The course also covers programming at assembly level.

## Introduction

This course is part of the first year master's program in computer engineering at the Politecnico di Torino. The main topics are:
• Advanced description of the basic microprocessor architecture
• Introduction to modern microprocessor architectures
• CISC, RISC and superscalar processor architectures, behavior and performance
• Microprocessor-based systems architecture
• Development flow of embedded system applications using a development board
• Advanced programming techniques for embedded systems: theory and practice
• Advanced assembly programming techniques (ARM, 8086): theory and practice.

## Laboratories

The `LabXX` directory contains the solutions to various laboratory assignments throughout the course. Each lab focuses on specific aspects of Computer systems architecture.

## Exams

The `ExamXXXXXXXX` directory hosts my solutions to the final exams conducted as part of the course. These exams required me to synthesize my knowledge and skills acquired throughout the semester to solve complex programming problems.

## Usage
